                    <p>
                        As the capstone project of my undergraduate degree, I designed and built a small prototype of a
                        self driving car. More information is available on the
                        <a href="https://daisybarrette.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/499poster_daisybarrette10110326.pdf"

                        that I presented during my live demo of the car at Queen’s University’s Creative Computing show.

                    <p>
                        I also presented it as a conference talk at the 2018

                    <h2>Temperature Tweets (IoT Project)</h2>

                    <p>
                        This was a group project for an upper year computer science course at Queen’s. A thermosensor
                        connected to an Arduino reads the current temperature, then the Arduino sends the temperature
                        data to a Carriots server. Carriots then sends this data out as a tweet.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My first introduction to Arduino & related technology was in a creative computing course at
                        Queen’s. My group’s final project was a stretching synthesizer, comprised of an Arduino, rubber
                        stretch sensors, and a program in Max MSP. You can
