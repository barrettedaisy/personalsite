            <p>
                This is a selection of technology / computer science related projects that I have worked on. You can
                also find me on <a href="https://github.com/daisybarrette">GitHub</a>.
            </p>

            <h2>Ultrasonic Self-Driving Car</h2>
            <p>
                As the capstone project of my undergraduate degree, I designed and built a small prototype of a self
                driving car. More information is available on the
                <a href="https://daisybarrette.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/499poster_daisybarrette10110326.pdf">academic poster</a>
                that I presented during my live demo
                of the car at Queen’s University’s Creative Computing show.
            </p>

            <h2>Temperature Tweets (IoT Project)</h2>

            <p>This was a group project for an upper year computer science course at Queen’s.
                A thermosensor connected to an Arduino reads the current temperature, then the Arduino sends the temperature data to a Carriots server.
                Carriots then sends this data out as a tweet.</p>
            <p>You can read more details on <a href="https://daisybarrette.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/cisc-340-project-2.pdf">this slideshow</a>,
                and see the
